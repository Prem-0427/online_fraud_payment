# 🛡️ Online Fraud Detection System

A Machine Learning based web application that detects fraudulent financial transactions using classification algorithms.  
The system predicts whether a transaction is Fraudulent or Legitimate based on transaction details.

---

## 📌 Project Description

Online financial fraud has increased significantly with digital transactions.  
This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions using supervised machine learning algorithms.

The model is trained on transaction data and deployed using Flask to provide real-time fraud prediction via a web interface.
