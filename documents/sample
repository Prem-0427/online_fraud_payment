ONLINE PAYMENT FRAUD DETECTION USING MACHINE 
LEARNING 
1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Project Overview 
Project Title:Online Payment Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning 
Team ID: LTVIP2026TMIDS63406 
Team Members: 
• Mannaru Prem Kumar 
• Anda Tharun 
• Chavva Tarun 
• Gaduputi Hima Varshini 
This project is a web-based intelligent system that detects fraudulent online transactions using 
machine learning. The system analyzes transaction data such as amount, transaction type, 
sender and receiver balances to identify whether a transaction is fraudulent or safe. 
1.2 Purpose 
The purpose of this project is to: 
• Prevent financial fraud in online payment systems 
• Help banks and digital payment platforms identify suspicious transactions 
• Provide a fast, automated fraud detection solution using machine learning 
2. IDEATION PHASE 
2.1 Problem Statement 
Online transactions are increasing rapidly, and so are online frauds. Manual verification is 
slow, costly, and inefficient. Fraudulent transactions cause huge financial losses to customers 
and banks. Therefore, there is a need for an automated system that can detect fraud accurately 
in real time.

2.3 Brainstorming 
Different solutions were considered: 
• Rule-based fraud detection 
• Manual verification 
• AI-based fraud detection 
Machine learning was chosen because it can detect hidden patterns and adapt to new fraud 
techniques. 
3. REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS

4. PROJECT DESIGN 
4.1 Problem–Solution Fit 
Online fraud is increasing. Our system provides an automated fraud detection tool, which fits 
the problem perfectly by improving security and reducing losses. 
4.2 Proposed Solution 
A web application integrated with a machine learning model that predicts fraudulent 
transactions using transaction details. 
4.3 Solution Architecture

6. FUNCTIONAL AND PERFORMANCE TESTING 
6.1 Performance Testing 
• The system predicts results within seconds 
• Handles multiple transactions efficiently 
• Tested with multiple sample values 
7. RESULTS 
The model successfully classifies transactions as: 
• Fraudulent 
• Safe 
The web interface shows the prediction clearly. 
7.1 Output Screenshots 
Screenshots include: 
• Home page 
• Fraud input page 
• Fraud / Safe result page 
8. ADVANTAGES & DISADVANTAGES 
Advantages 
• Fast fraud detection 
• Reduces financial loss 
• Automated system 
• Easy to use 
Disadvantages 
• Depends on dataset quality 
• May give false predictions 
• Needs retraining for new fraud patterns 

9. CONCLUSION 
This project provides an efficient solution for detecting online payment fraud. By using 
machine learning, the system improves transaction security and helps financial institutions 
reduce fraud losses. 
10. FUTURE SCOPE 
• Add real-time fraud detection 
• Use deep learning models 
• Add user login and dashboards 
• Mobile app integration 
• Cloud deployment
